# Diabetes-Prediction-System
A simple machine learning model based on classification technique in Python that diagnostically predicts whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. 
This dataset used is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
I used Logistic Regression and KNN for this, and compared accuracy scores of both techniques.
Using KNN, I got an accuracy of 79.2%
Using Logistic Regression, I got accuracy of 81.8%.
